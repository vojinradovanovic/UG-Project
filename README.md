# UG-Project

**Project title:** Mathematical Modelling of Macular Holes using Finite Element Modelling

Codes for mechanical models (MATLAB):
* ```vitreous_model_v5.m```: the function which defines and runs the model; it is customizable with input parameters
* ```test_file.m```: the file I used to interact with  ```vitreous_model_v5.m```

Codes for FEM models (FreeFEM):
* ```test.edp```: the initial testing of FreeFEM with a heat equation (Section 5.3.1)
* ```test_vmt.edp```: initial test of simple VMT model in 2D (Section 5.4.1)
* ```3d_vmt.edp```: 3D VMT model, contains only the vitreous and the retina (Section 5.4.2)
* ```3d_ilm.edp```: precursor to ```3d_loading.edp```, does not include von Mises (not discussed in submission)
* ```3d_loading.edp```: 3D VMT model, contains the vitreous, ILM and the retina, as well as von Mises simulation (Section 5.4.3)
* ```main.edp```: The main FEM code (Section 5.4.4 onward)

Videos generated by FreeFEM code are named ```code-name_force(_area_variable).mp4```.

FreeFEM needs to be installed to run the ```.edp``` files.
