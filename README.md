# UG-Project

**Project title:** Mathematical Modelling of Macular Holes using Finite Element Modelling

This file contains several codes:
* ```main```: The main FEM code (in 2D).
* ```main_3d```: The 3D version of ```main```.
* ```test```: the initial testing of FreeFEM.
* ```test_vmt```: initial test of simple model VMT.
* ```3d_vmt```: contains forces, no ILM, no stress visualisation
* ```3d_ilm```: contains forces and ILM, no stress visualisation
